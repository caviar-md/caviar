## What is this CAVIAR?
CAVIAR is a molecular dynamics (MD) package developed by Morad Biagooi and 
Ehsan Nedaaee Oskoee. 


## What it can do?
CAVIAR main goal is the simulation of soft materials at nano scale. However,
it can do much more. Handling complex geometries for MD is its speciallity.


## What programming languages are used?
The core is written in C++ with C++11 standard. The configurations for compile
is done using CMake. Some bash shell script are also used as tools for pre and
post processing. 


## What about scripting language?
CAVIAR has a built-in scripting language. It is one command per line. 
We claim that it is easy to learn and understand. See documentations and 
examples.


## CAVIAR as a library?
CAVIAR can be used like a C++ static library. We have provided some examples
for users.


## How to learn and use it?
The easiest way is to develop your simulation script from a working example.
Read the documentations and try to run your scripts accordingly.


## Requirements?
We have developed CAVIAR with g++ compiler on ubuntu OS:
  (g++ (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.11) 5.4.0 20160609)
In addition to that, a deal.II (Version 8.5.1 ) library with for finite element 
calculations is used. 
Any lower version of these compilers or libraries may not work with CAVIAR,
specially if it does not support C++11 standards completely.
Higher versions may-or-maynot work depending on deprecations of the commands
that we have used. If you find any information about this, we gladly accept and
add it to our documentations.


## What is its license?
