A post processing code for the output of 'plt_dealii' force_field.

This is a simple code to help calculating mean of induced charges on each of 
electrodes by id.

The files starting with 'o_' are some example data, input and output.

To compile,

 $ ./compile.sh

Then run,

 $ ./mean_charges

Follow the comments in the "main_mean_induced_charges.cpp" and you will know
