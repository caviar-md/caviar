This example shows 4 different ways to simulate the repulsive effects of a spherical geometry.
Two of the cases uses a vtk mesh and the other two uses a pure mathematical description of a sphere.
In another view, two of the examples use LJ potential and the other two use granular linear spring-dashpot for the interactions.
