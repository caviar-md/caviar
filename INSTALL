# CAVIAR Package Installation Guide

Building the CAVIAR package is a straightforward process with minimal requirements. Follow these simple steps:

1. **Navigate to the Build Directory**:

   ```bash
   $ cd ${BUILD_DIRECTORY}
   ```

   If you don't have a designated build directory, create one.

2. **Execute CMake**:

   Use the CMake tool to configure the build process by providing the path to the CAVIAR source code:

   ```bash
   $ cmake ${PATH_TO_CAVIAR}
   ```

3. **Compile the Package**:

   Once CMake configuration is complete, proceed with the compilation:

   ```bash
   $ make
   ```

Upon successful compilation, a file named 'CAVIAR' will be generated.

To test the installation, you can run an example using the following command:

```bash
$ ./CAVIAR < ${PATH_TO_CAVIAR}/examples/e1-two-atoms/e1-two-atoms.fcpp
```
