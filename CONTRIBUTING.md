## About contributions
CAVIAR is a state-of-the-art software package. It can be developed in any
direction that the major of users need it to be. 


## Bug report
If you have encountered any problem while building or using CAVIAR, please
report it to 'm.biagooi .at. gmail.com'. We will have fix it as soon as possible.
There are three kind of bugs one can encounter:

1- Compile time bug: There should not have to be bug or error while building any
 realease version of CAVIAR. If something like that happened, there might be a problem
in compiler or library versions. Contact us about it.

2- Run time bug: If it is reported by an 'ERROR' massage of CAVIAR's
 interperter, please double check the script. If there's a segmentation fault,
you can use gdb to check the core file and find the problem. After that, contact
us and send your script to fix the problem.
Another type of bug is when the system freezes during an MPI run. It would be
hard to find the problem unless you send us the script.

3- Result bug: If your simulation result was not as it should be in a standard 
test simulation, there may be a problem in the parameters settings in the 
scripts. Also, there's a small possibility that the implemented algorithm is not
complete enough to support the physics of your problem. You can contact us and
 we check the problem.
