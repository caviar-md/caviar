-- goal: Debye length calculation.

Debye length: The distance in which the potential value is about 1/e of the electrode potential.

case 1) Process: Output the potential values on a grid while running the code.
-> We need another code to average the potential per distance to the electrodes.


case 2) Post Process:  '*.xyz' -> import -> run one timestep -> get the potential values on a 3D/2D grid and output it in a file.
-> We need another code to average the potential per distance to the electrodes.

we have a xyz file that contains many time-steps each one having the position of the charged particles.
many time-steps: on each one, we have potential on multiple points.

------
priority:
(1) develop caviar to get output for potentials.
(2) Develop a code to average over the mentioned output and get the debyle length.
(3) make the code faster by developing boundary element and finite difference. (Check the radial distribution functions for water and water-salt).
(4) Run the simulations for different values of potential differences.
(5) ...
